RAG System Implementation Guide

Introduction
This document explains how to implement a production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using BGE-M3 embeddings and Milvus vector database.

Architecture Overview
The RAG system consists of three main components:
1. Document Processing Pipeline - Handles PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
2. Vector Storage - Uses Milvus for similarity search
3. Content Storage - Uses MinIO for full document content

Document Processing
Documents are processed through several stages:
- Text extraction from various formats
- Smart chunking based on semantic boundaries
- Quality scoring to filter low-quality chunks
- Deduplication to remove similar content
- Token counting using BGE-M3 tokenizer

The chunking process uses a sliding window approach with configurable chunk size (default 800 tokens) and overlap (default 100 tokens). Each chunk receives a quality score based on information density, coherence, and length.

Vector Embeddings
The system uses BGE-M3 (BAAI General Embedding Model v3) for generating embeddings. BGE-M3 provides:
- 1024-dimensional dense vectors
- Support for multiple languages
- High performance on retrieval tasks
- Efficient batch processing

Vector Storage with Milvus
Milvus serves as the vector database with the following features:
- HNSW indexing for fast similarity search  
- Partition-based organization by RAG system
- Configurable similarity metrics (L2, IP, COSINE)
- Scalable horizontal architecture

Content Storage with MinIO
MinIO provides S3-compatible object storage for:
- Full document content storage
- Chunk content with metadata
- URI-based access pattern
- Health monitoring and statistics

Search and Retrieval
The search process involves:
1. Query embedding generation using BGE-M3
2. Vector similarity search in Milvus
3. Content retrieval from MinIO using URIs
4. Optional reranking for improved relevance
5. Context assembly for LLM generation

Performance Optimization
Several optimizations are implemented:
- Tokenizer sharing between components
- Singleton model managers
- Efficient memory usage patterns
- Batch processing support
- Device management (CPU/GPU)

Quality Assurance
The system includes comprehensive evaluation:
- Recall@K and Precision@K metrics
- NDCG for ranking quality
- Latency measurements
- Success rate tracking
- Automated threshold validation

Production Deployment
For production deployment, configure:
- Environment variables for services
- Docker containers for Milvus and MinIO
- Load balancing and scaling
- Monitoring and alerting
- Backup and recovery procedures

This RAG implementation provides a robust foundation for building intelligent document retrieval systems with high performance and production-grade reliability.
